v0.7.2:
  * improve the documentation and the tutorials
v0.7.1:
  * use pyfftw if environment variable YAM_FFTW is set and different from "no" or "false"
    (before pyfftw was used if environment variable was set, regardless of its value)
v0.7.0:
  * consequently use float16 in the code,
    switching to other dtypes may not be completely supported at this point and
    the possibility to change the dtype may be removed later
  * use --njobs 0 for sequential processing (before it was 1)
    and --njobs 1 for processing of each element in a new process
  * index for cross-correlation is nested one level deeper now to not have
    too many datsets in one group for cross-correlations of 10min data pieces
  * add new plottype: velocity change versus time of different station/component combinations
    together with joint estimate
  * allow to set compression and other options when creating a dataset
  * allow to set libver for new HDF5 files (default is 'earliest' for best backwards compatibility)
v0.6.0:
  * yam can now be used on Windows, tests are passing, but multiproccesing is not yet working
    (see issue #4)
v0.5.0:
  * major refactoring of stretch module, some config options for stretching are renamed,
    the resulting dictionaries changed in a backwards incompatible way, please (a) use
    yam version < 0.5 or (b) adapt config file and run yam stretch again for any existing project
v0.4.3:
  * add demean option (before filtering)
  * add plugin option for timenorm
  * refactor timenorm function, some kwargs are deprecated
  * timenorm and spectral_whitening are now working with Trace objects (instead of numpy arrays)
  * add dpi option for most plots to set resolution of saved images
  * more verbose error message if coordinates of station cannot be found
  * fix: guarantee same length of traces which are correlated (necessary if tolerance_shift is set)
v0.4.2:
  * adapt to GFZ FDSN webservices and allow only 1 thread when downloading example data
v0.4.1:
  * extension of images is now specified without dot, e.g. 'png', 'pdf'
v0.4.0:
  * rename plotting options setting x- and y-limits to xlim and ylim
  * parallel processing for stretching, reference trace must be used (--reftr)
  * allow full stack with '' or 'all' (e.g. for creating a refence trace)
  * parallel processing for full stack
  * store correlations and sim_mat as half precission float16 by default
  * fix various small bugs
  * move some functions to new io module
v0.3.0:
  * add scan subcommand
  * add debug option (--pdb)
  * add exhaustive online documentation
  * add possibility to correlate "R" and "T" rotated components (experimental)
  * add --parallel-inner-loop feasible for correlating many stations
  * downsample now performed before preprocessing
  * add decimate option (downsampling after preprocessing)
  * reduce run time of tests
  * fix: timenorm "clip" was not correctly working
  * fix: timenorm "mute_envelope" was not working with masked data
v0.2.1:
  * refactor part of the imaging module
  * rename some kwargs in imaging module
v0.2.0:
  * rename read_stretch to read_dicts
  * remove unnecessary "root" group in HDF5 files
  * change stretch to velocity change inside dictionary returned by read_stretch (sign change)
  * change unit of velocity change and str_range to %
  * corr_vs_time plot: allow to plot stack at top
  * allow strings for length and overlap option in correlate config (e.g. "1h" for one hour)
  * fix: correctly plot gaps in corr_vs_time and sim_mat plots
  * fix: downsample now defaults to None (previous default: 10)
v0.1.2:
  * fix: remove_response option was not working
v0.1.0:
  * initial release
